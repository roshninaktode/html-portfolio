<p>Hello! My name is Roshni Naktode, and I am a passionate and dedicated learner with a strong academic background in science and a growing interest in the field of technology. I have successfully completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Science, where I developed a solid foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and research skills. My curiosity and drive to explore new areas led me to transition into the world of computer applications.</p>

<p>Currently, I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Application (MCA), which is helping me deepen my understanding of programming, software development, and the broader world of information technology. Through this course, I am building a wide range of technical skills that I aim to use in real-world applications and future projects.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have recently started learning web development. I am exploring front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm gradually moving toward back-end development. This journey has been both exciting and enriching, as it allows me to combine creativity with logic to build interactive and responsive websites.</p>

<p>I am eager to grow as a developer, contribute to real-world projects, and become a part of the tech community. With my background in science and ongoing training in computer applications, I am confident in my ability to adapt, learn, and make meaningful contributions in the field of technology.</p>
